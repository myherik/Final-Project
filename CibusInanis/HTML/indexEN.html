                Vi wish to decrease the amount of unnecessary packing currently being used - especially low degradable

                packaging.

                In the store we will keep whatever food possible in large containers. This will apply especially to all
                kinds of dry food – pasta, cereal, nuts, chips etc. The customer will be able to bring their own
                containers or bags and fill them up, then pay based on weight. Fruit will also not be packaged,
                but sold separately.

            <br>
            <p tabindex="0">
                We will sell containers in the store, so the customers can buy them from us directly. This will be
                especially helpful if they did not bring enough containers from home or if they forgot. The containers
                will be environmentally friendly and be made from sustainable materials, recyclable plastic or glass.
                We will also sell reusable shopping bags.

                A lot of processed and pre-made food are packaged. Because of this we want to focus on fresh produce,

                We are not going to have special offers that encourage food waste. An example of this is 3-for-2 offers
                or price drops, which often lead the customer to buy unnecessary food they do not use and later throw
                away. Instead, we would like to have personal offers based on the customers spending habits.

                We also want to limit emissions by making sure our products have not travelled unnecessarily far.

                be packaged.

        <br>
        <p tabindex="0">Zero waste is a kind of lifestyle that has become more and more popular with the escalating
            pressure about the climate problem. The lifestyle is about making as little waste as possible.
            This is often done by buying as little packaging as possible, trying to cut food waste and being
            better at reusing stuff and clothes. Zero waste pioneer Bea Johnson has a method to cut down the
            amount of waste you use, by following the five R’s in this
            order<sup><a href="sources.html#første" title="Link 1">1</a></sup>:

        <h3 class="sticky" tabindex="0"><strong>Why is it important?</strong> </h3>
        <br>
        <p tabindex="0">
            In Norway we produce so much waste that if everyone in this world would produce as much waste as us, we
            would need 3.4 earth globes <sup><a href="sources.html#andre" title="Link 2">2</a></sup>. The problem is that
            the expenditure increases, and so does the waste.
            An average Norwegian produces more waste than the average in
            Europe<sup><a href="sources.html#tredje" title="link 3">3</a></sup>. An
            average European produce around
            487 kg of waste, but an average Norwegian produce around 748 kg of waste.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p tabindex="0">
            We want to reduce the amount of waste in Norway because waste can have a direct effect on the climate. Bad
            waste management and littering can change ecosystems, and it has become an increasing problem for the ocean
            <sup><a href="sources.html#tredje" title="link 3">3</a></sup>. Lots of
            low degradable waste such as plastic and rubber end up in the ocean, and that creates problems
            for animals and humans. There is also an indirect consequence of waste, so if the waste doesn’t get
            recycled, the we lose the resources.

        <p tabindex="0">We see this as an opportunity to lower the request for packaging by taking away what is
            unnecessary. We create so much waste because of packaging of food and products, and so much of this
            packaging is not necessary. If we don’t need packaging anymore, then we will reduce the amount of waste at
            home and we will save resources by not producing unnecessary packaging.
